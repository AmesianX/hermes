# hermes

A simple python-based group chat server built on XMPP. Hermes lets you easily manage chatrooms for friends or colleagues.

## How it Works

Supply your own XMPP-based (e.g. GMail/Google Talk) accounts to serve as chatroom hosts, add a lil' bit of configuration, and start it. Chatroom members simply chat with the host account. Hermes broadcasts the message to all other members on its behalf.
